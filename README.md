# mine-fighterz-pygame
To learn pygame I am recreating mine fighterz in pygame.
The original Mine Fighterz! game can be found at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/226924571/. Mine Fighterz! was a game created by QuickAttack on Scratch.
All projects on the scratch website are freely remixable, and it's even encouraged.

The context of this game is that in science class we had to make a scratch project which contains information about minerals. I was in the class with him (QuickAttack), and I thought the project was pretty cool. All of the remixes of the project by Staining are from me. I made them as a joke.

Anyway, I think that recreating the project in pygame will help me learn it. The reason I want to learn pygame is to escape the text environment all my programs are stuck in. I want real graphics.

However this is probably one of the things I try that I give up on after 2 weeks, because I got bored. Happens all the time.

My scratch is https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Staining but you won't find anything interesting; it's all cringe.
